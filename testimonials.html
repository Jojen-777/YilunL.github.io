            <p>Below are comments that my students have left for me each semester. 
            These are anonymous quotes directly from the Instructor Evaluation reports, I have not edited any of them!</p>
            
            <h1>Fall 2016 - Math 114 (Alexandersson)</h1>
            <ul> 
                <li>"BEST TA EVER!! Ivan is super helpful when it comes to learning the material and always goes the extra mile to make sure students understand."</li>
                <li>"Most amazing TA I've had or could ever imagine having. Explained hard concepts to me in ways that made sense, was a great role model, and always made time for his students. Would not have understood the course material nearly as well without him."</li> 
                <li>"Phenomenal TA. Always available to answer my questions and did a much better job at explaining the material than the teacher. Highly recommend!"</li>
                <li>"Ivan was an amazing TA. He is so intelligent and can answer questions VERY clearly. I cannot imagine having had a better TA. He gives not just amazing math advice but also general guidance on college and majors. Wonderful."</li>
                <li>"Ivan is a fantastic TA who is able to understand a student's perspective and answer questions/teach material accordingly. He was very accessible outside of class and responded to emails very quickly. His recitations were useful for understanding the material better. I have no complaints."</li>
                <li>"Ivan helped me so much in this class. Sometimes it felt like recitation taught me more than lecture."</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Spring 2017 - Math 114 (Hablicsek) - Won TA Award</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>"Ivan was an amazing TA. Sometimes he taught the material better than the professor. I am very lucky to have had him for the course."</li>
                <li>"I was at times frustrated that Prof Hablicsek didn't post any notes online. It was difﬁcult to rely exclusively on Rimmer's notes when studying. Ivan was amazing, seriously so good."</li>
                <li>"Absolutely amazing TA. Really helped solidify my understanding of the material."</li>
                <li>"Ivan was incredible as a TA. He seemed very passionate about math. Not only that he seemed very passionate about helping learn so that we could develop the level of knowledge he had about Math. Overall, he was an A+ TA."</li>
                <li>"IVAN IS THE MOST AWESOME TA I'VE EVER MET. He is accountable, easy to reach out, friendly and even very fast in scoring. He is very clear when teaching materials for 114!!"</li>
                <li>"Awesome TA! Really knew what he was talking about and was friendly and highly available via both emails and ofﬁce hours."</li>
                <li>"Ivan is the best TA I've had during my time at Penn in any class."</li>
                <li>"Ivan is the only reason I know anything about 114 he is literally a godsend 1000% would recommend him"</li>
                <li>"Absolutely amazing TA! So accessible, patient, and helpful. Taught me everything I know about math 114. Much more helpful than the professor himself. Would recommend Ivan (Yilun) as a TA to anyone."</li>
                <li>"Ivan's website and many many resources truly helped me learn calculus! His email responses were always extremely fast, and he held many ofﬁce hours and review sessions for us. An amazing TA!! Would not have learned calculus without his help!"</li>
                <li>"Without the help of the TA, I probably would have done much worse on exams and would have a weaker grasp on the content. The TA really knows how to explain the content well and answers questions appropriately. A very great job in helping students and being an important resource for them."</li>
                <li>"should win math ta award if there was one..."</li>
            </ul>
